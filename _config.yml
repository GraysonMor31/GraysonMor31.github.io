  I recently graduated from Colorado State University with a BSc in Computer Science, but my passion for computing started long before that. As early as middle school, I had a habit of taking things apart just to see how they worked. I wanted to understand everything about electrical systems, even if it meant breaking a few small appliances along the way. Eventually, I channeled that curiosity into something more constructive—building my first computer during my freshman year of high school.

  From that moment on, I was hooked. Computers, to most people, were just another tool or even pure magic, but I wanted to know more. Unfortunately, my high school didn’t offer computer science classes, so I turned to engineering as the next best thing. I loved math and physics, and since engineers worked with computers daily, how different could it be? As it turned out, very different. I quickly realized engineering wasn’t for me and found myself at a crossroads—stay in a field that didn’t excite me or switch to something else.

  After some research, I discovered CSU’s Computer Information Systems (CIS) program, which blended business and computer science. It seemed like a practical choice, so I gave it a shot. However, after one semester, I realized the business side didn’t interest me, and the computer science courses barely scratched the surface of what I wanted to learn.

  That summer, I had the opportunity to shadow family members working in cybersecurity. Seeing their work firsthand made everything click—I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I switched my major to Computer Science with a concentration in Networks & Security, and I never looked back.

  With my new focus, I fully embraced learning. Programming, problem-solving, hardware, software, networking, security principles—I absorbed everything I could. I landed a job at CSU’s IT department, where I gained hands-on experience troubleshooting systems, configuring networks, building workstations, and even leading training sessions for non-IT departments. This role gave me exposure to different IT teams and strengthened my technical and communication skills.

  In my senior year, I took my experience a step further by interning at Woodward, Inc. as an IT Cybersecurity Intern. Initially, I worked with SIEM tools and monitoring systems, which introduced me to a new side of IT—Operational Technology (OT) in a manufacturing environment. IT security in this space was entirely different from traditional enterprise IT, and learning about its unique challenges was eye-opening.

  Later in my internship, I shifted toward compliance and risk management, where I tested AI-driven compliance management tools and conducted third-party risk assessments. I loved this work because it allowed me to collaborate with diverse teams while gaining a deeper understanding of security frameworks and governance.

  Now, I’m looking for a <mark>full-time</mark> role in <mark>IT or cybersecurity</mark>, where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and contribute to a team that values security, efficiency, and innovation.
